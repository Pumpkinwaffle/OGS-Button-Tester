## General info
This is the example app provided with <a href="https://github.com/Pumpkinwaffle/EmuELEC-OGS-Godot">EmuELEC-OGS-Godot</a>.

I'll have an empty Godot Project template pre configured for the OGS uploaded soon. If you need assistance, come to the <a href="https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=193&t=39708&sid=45e9324b1ef05e4651f6a79924689f34">Hardkernel Forums</a>.

## Instructions
#### Make note of the settings in:
* `Project Settings > general > Window:` width: 480, height: 854
* `Project Settings > general > audio` Mix Rate: 48000, Output Latency: 20
* `Project Settings > Input Map` The OGS's button correspond to an Xbox360 controller (only expetion being the function keys)
* `Project Settings > Autoload` The OGS screen is in portrait, this script handles the rotations so you don't have to think about it.
