# OGS-Button-Tester
A Godot project with inputs setup for the Odroid Go Super. Doubles as a button tester.

## General info
This is the example app provided with my 'Godot OGS EmuELEC config'(coming soon).

Use it as reference to set in inputs in your own projects. Other than function keys, everything is mapped to match an xbox360 controller.
You might want to use the <b>autoload.gd</b> script in your own projects to avoid having to deal with the screen rotations manually.

## Instructions
Make sure to setup Godot on your OGS first.
* 'link to Godot OGS soon'

Use the <b>frt_100_332_arm64.bin</b> template if you want to make your own build.
